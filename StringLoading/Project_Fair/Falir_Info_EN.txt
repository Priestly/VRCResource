On a quiet hill somewhere in Japan,
a small manor stands, watching over the city below.
Through its windows, rain-softened lights drift across the night,
gently wrapping around us just as we are.

The shifting sound of rain reflects the heart’s weather.
Sometimes, the clouds blur even the things we hold dear.

Memories we failed to share,
words that never quite reached someone,
slowly melt into the rain when we entrust them to its rhythm.

Even if our feelings don’t reach perfectly,
the very act of facing them is enough for the world to answer—if only slightly.

With a warm cup of coffee in hand,
why not search for a small kisekí of your own?

Beyond the glass, the city lights—
touched by a break in the clouds and a pale rainbow—
may shine with a softer contrast than before.
