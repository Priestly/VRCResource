Amber Wavelet ~Kohaku iro~

A guest room in the same Western-style mansion as the previous work, Blue Contrail ~Gunjo~—a place made for staying through the “night.”
It exists between the real and the virtual,
a “room that never changes,”
where you can always find your way back.

If the word “Welcome home” had a color, it would be—Amber.
A color that gently seals passing time
and softly holds the light of memory.

The master of the mansion is still on a journey.
Yet the cats once loved by that master
will find you and come to greet you—
as if following the quiet trail of a dream.

Here, the ordinary and the extraordinary blend together.
For some, it is a refuge.
For others, a mirror that reflects their inner self.

To the travelers who feel a little weary from living in the “now,”
in this room, time and words
will ripple softly once more, then fall still.

The cats come simply
to confirm that you are here.

Welcome—
to the amber-colored night.
