If the word “welcome home”
had a color—
it would probably be amber.

A color that gently holds the passing of time,
quietly cradling the light of memory.

This is a guest room for the night,
within the same mansion as Gunjo Contrail.
A place to shed the weight of reality
and return to your true self.

The master of the house is still on a journey.
In their place, the cats who watch over this room come to greet you.
They speak no words,
yet their gaze makes it unmistakably clear—
welcome home.

For some, this place is a refuge.
For others, a surface of water
that softly reflects who they are.

Here, time and language gently stir once,
then settle into a sea of amber.

That you are here,
simply as yourself—
the cats come only to confirm this, with quiet affection.

—Welcome to an amber-colored night.
