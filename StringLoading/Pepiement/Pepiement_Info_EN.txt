Beneath the tracks of Shibuya lies a boundary to this world.
The roar of the elevated train fades into the distance, as the scent of the tide envelops you.
There, a pavilion appears—a birdcage woven from light and sea breeze.
It is a small, secluded garden by the sea, a sanctuary cut off from the urban clamor.
Though shielded from the world outside, an unparalleled sense of freedom drifts upon the air.
This is a place where emotions, lost and adrift, are cradled by the waves and can quietly breathe again.
What was given to you, and what you offered in return...
The light, the scents, the warmth you felt in your hand—do you still remember them?
In time, your own heart will be cleansed by the waves, dissolving into the shimmering sand.
And when the tumult of your emotions grows still, all that remains reflected on the water's surface is the serene contour of your true self.
――Pepiement.
A cage of birdsong by the sea.
That song is the sound of your heart finding its freedom.
